## How to create a unique Fibonacci Tattoo?

[Live page](https://dangarfield.github.io/fibonacci-tattoo/)

I was thinking about tattoos and wanted something unique. I love maths, programming and the golden ratio, for many reasons: connection to art, science, the divine fingerprint, the observable natural laws, simplicity in complexity, complexity in simplicity.

So... I thought what tattoo could I get that would show this, other than the standard golden ratio swirls.

It turns out that you can plot a fractional increment of the numbers BETWEEN the fibnacci numbers. 0.1 etc.

Binet's formula calculates the 'nth' value of the Fibonacci sequence:

It also works with fractional values, however, you cannot have a negative base with the fractional exponent, so instead, you have to calculate it using complex numbers.

Each intersection of the y axis shows the fibonacci sequence numnbers, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 etc
